// This configuration file sets up Tailwind CSS for a React project.
// It specifies the paths to the content files where Tailwind CSS classes will be used,
// extends the default theme, and includes no additional plugins at this time.
// The file is structured to be compatible with the latest Tailwind CSS version.

// To use this configuration, ensure that Tailwind CSS is installed in your project.
// You can customize the theme further by adding colors, fonts, and other design tokens as needed.

// Note: The `content` array includes paths to HTML and JavaScript files where Tailwind classes will be applied.
// Adjust the paths as necessary based on your project's structure.
// This file is typically located at `frontend/tailwind.config.js` in a React project structure.
